    <h1>Classes In JS</h1>
    <p>
      Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with
      code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also
      have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Class and Object</h2>
    <p>
      A class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it
      describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and
      defines the operations (called methods). object: an object is an element
      (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.

      class BankAccount {
        customerName;
        balance;
        accountNumber;
        constructor(customerName, balance = 0) {
          this.customerName = customerName;
          this.balance = +balance;
          this.accountNumber = Date.now();
        }
        deposit = (amount) => {
          this.balance += amount;
        };
        withdraw = (amount) => {
          this.balance -= amount;
        };
      }
